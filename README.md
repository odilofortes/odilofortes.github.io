This webpage was made as a project for the subject 21755-Tecnología Multimedia of Computer Engineering in the University of Balearic Islands (UIB).

Its main purpose is to show information about videogames. While the videogames available are fixed (they are in our own JSON), all the media info about them is dynamic, which means the user is able to check on the latest YT videos, latest tweets from the main Twitter account of the videogame, and if the selected Twitch streamer is on live, the stream will also be shown. 

Academically, the aim was to learn how to create a webpage, and then more specifically how to manipulate data in JSON format, for example to use APIs.
